LittleProxy is simple, fast and useful, but the project seems abandoned, so
let's fork it and advance it a little, under a new name.

See build.nw for build instructions.

See README-orig.md for the original README.

See README-mitm.md for integrated MITM extension from Frank Ganske, it was
taken from https://github.com/ganskef/LittleProxy-mitm.

These READMEs are for context and reference only.
